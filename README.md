What we still have to do:
1)Link the data to show the stock price when the stock symbol is pressed 
2)create a user input blocker that checks if their input is a proper Stock symbol - run a api request on the token then if error pops up handle with not allowing stock to be added to list work on idea ed sullivan showed  
-stock detection error message {"chart":{"result":null,"error":{"code":"Not Found","description":"No data found, symbol may be delisted"}}}
3)fix app icon -for Bryan
